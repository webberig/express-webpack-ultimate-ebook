One of the constants in the universe is that repetition is the mother of skill. The things I put in this book came from
trial and error and learning from (often bad) experiences. I hope you have learned from those experiences by reading 
this book, and wish you the best of luck in your next Express/Webpack projects.
 
Even it seems tempting to just blindly copy the sample project for your own use, I highly recommend to go through the 
process at least once. A common error in software development is starting your project from some shiny starter or
boilerplate. But when shit hits the fan, you end up reverse engineering your project to find the cause. This usually
happens at the worst timing ever (that's a universal constant too).

That being said, I created a fork of the sample code that you can use as a boilerplate. I'm freezing the 
sample code to maintain a proper reference to this book, but the boilerplate will remain updated and will be expanded
 with more features such as linting and testing.
